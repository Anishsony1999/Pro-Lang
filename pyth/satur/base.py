# programing 2 type type language
# 1, lowlevel language - 0101010
# 2, high level language - English


# highlevel language  to lowlwevel language - complier and interpreter

# complier vs interpreter
# complier - compile the entire code and generate the output
# interpreter - line by line translation of the code and generate the output

# python is a highlevel language
# python is a interpreted language

# python is a dynamically typed language
# python is a statically typed language


# variable
# variable is a name that is used to store a value
# variable is a reference to a value

# comments
# comments are used to explain the code
# interpreter will ignore the comments

# in python we must keep space 
# python is a case sensitive language


x = 10 # x is the name of the variable and 10 is the value
name = "Anish"

print(x) # 10
print(name) # Anish

# data types
# int, float, string, boolean:


x = 10 # x is integer data type
y = 10.5 # y is float data type
name = "Anish" # name is string data type 
is_true = False # is_true is boolean data type
