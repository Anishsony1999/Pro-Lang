# programing 2 type type language
# 1, lowlevel language - 0101010
# 2, high level language - English


# highlevel language  to lowlwevel language - complier and interpreter

# complier vs interpreter
# complier - compile the entire code and generate the output
# interpreter - line by line translation of the code and generate the output

# python is a highlevel language
# python is a interpreted language

# python is a dynamically typed language
# python is a statically typed language


# variable
# variable is a name that is used to store a value
# variable is a reference to a value

# comments
# comments are used to explain the code
# interpreter will ignore the comments

# in python we must keep space 
# python is a case sensitive language


x = 10 # x is the name of the variable and 10 is the value
name = "Anish"

print(x) # 10
print(name) # Anish

# data types
# int, float, string, boolean:


x = 10 # x is integer data type
y = 10.5 # y is float data type
name = "Anish" # name is string data type 
is_true = False # is_true is boolean data type

# type() is used to check the data type of the variable

print(type(x)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'float'>
print(type(name)) # <class 'str'>
print(type(is_true)) # <class 'bool'>

# operators
# +, -, *, /, %, **, //

# print() # -> useing print function to print a new line or printing value in the same line
# type() # -> useing type function to check the data type of the variable
# input()  # -> useing input function to take input from the user


# name = input(" Enter Your Name: ")

# type casting
#--------------

x = "10"
print(type(x)) # <class 'str'>

x = int(x)
print(type(x)) # <class 'int'>

x = float(x)
print(type(x)) # <class 'float'>

x = 20

x = str(x)
print(type(x))

x = int(name) # Error because name is a string data type and we can't convert string to integer
